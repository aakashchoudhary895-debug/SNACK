- Purpose: Convey scientific authority while maintaining accessibility and reducing cognitive load

**Layout Paradigm:**
- Asymmetric two-column layout: research content on left, data visualizations on right
- Modular card system with consistent spacing (8px grid)
- Sticky sidebar navigation for research sections
- Full-width hero with minimal imagery

**Signature Elements:**
- Subtle geometric dividers between sections (horizontal lines with varying opacity)
- Data-driven infographics with custom chart styling
- Research methodology flowchart as a visual anchor
- Comparison tables with alternating row colors

**Interaction Philosophy:**
- Smooth scroll-triggered animations for data reveals
- Hover states that highlight related data points
- Expandable sections for detailed methodology
- Interactive comparison sliders for product analysis

**Animation:**
- Fade-in animations on scroll for research findings (300ms ease-out)
- Subtle scale transforms on hover for interactive elements (200ms)
- Staggered animations for list items in methodology sections
- Progress indicators for research phases

**Typography System:**
- Display: IBM Plex Sans Bold for section headings (48px, 52px line-height)
- Body: IBM Plex Sans Regular for content (16px, 24px line-height)
- Data: IBM Plex Mono for numerical values and technical specifications
- Hierarchy: Bold for key findings, regular for supporting text
