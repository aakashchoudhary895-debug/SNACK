MAIN FINDINGS:
- Fried chips: 1,245 μg/kg acrylamide, 34.2 g/100g fat
- Baked commercial: 250-500 μg/kg acrylamide, 15-20 g/100g fat
- Prototypes: <125 μg/kg acrylamide, <11.5 g/100g fat, >9.5 g/100g fiber
- Cost savings: 52% reduction vs commercial products
- Consumer acceptability: Comparable to commercial baked snacks
